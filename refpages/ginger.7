The rhizomes are widely used in many areas of the world as a flavouring, adding a hot, spicy flavour[301 ]. They are added to dishes such as cakes, curries, chutneys, stir-fry dishes, candies etc[301 ]. They are also commonly used in beverages, especially ginger beer[301 ]. The roots can be used fresh, where a small amount of the grated root is added to the dish, or the root can be dried and ground into a powder, when it will store well for later use. The dried root is about twice as pungent as the fresh root[238 ]. The very young rhizomes, known as stem ginger, are peeled and eaten raw in salads, pickled, or cooked in syrup and made into sweetmeats[301 ]. The young, slightly spicy leaves and young shoots can be eaten as a potherb, or pureed and used in sauces and dips[298 , 301 ]. The leaves can also be used to wrap food whilst it is cooked[301 ]. The young inflorescences can be eaten raw[301 ]. An essential oil obtained from the root is used in flavouring essences[418 ].

.Sh PFAF ENTRY
Ginger root is widely used in Eastern Herbal treatments - in Ayurveda it is known as the universal medicine and it is an ingredient of about half of all prescriptions in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine[238 ]. The root is rich in volatile oils, gingerols and shogaols[238 ]. The shogaols are only produced when the root is dried, as a breakdown substance of the gingerols[238 ]. They are twice as pungent as the gingerols and so the dried root is normally used in different ways to the fresh root[238 ]. The root is a sweet, pungent, aromatic, warming herb that is expectorant; increases perspiration; improves digestion and liver function; controls nausea, vomiting and coughing; stimulates the circulation; relaxes spasms; and relieves pain[238 ]. The root is used internally in the treatment of all forms of nausea, including morning and motion sickness[238 ]. It is used to treat indigestion, colic, abdominal chills, colds, coughs, influenza and peripheral circulatory problems[238 ]. Externally, the root is used to treat spasmodic pain, rheumatism, lumbago, menstrual cramps and sprains[238 ].
